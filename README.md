- 👋 Hi, I’m @salvadorpantoja
- 👀 I live in NYC and I'm interested in the intersection between creative video production and code.
- 🌱 I’m mostly working with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Node for my projects, but also tinker with Python and Raspberry Pis.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects.
- :surfing_man: When I am not working you can find me creating fun projects with my daughter or surfing at Rockaway Beach.
